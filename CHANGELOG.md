# Change Log

## Version 2.0.0 - 2016-04-08
- Feature: Complete rewrite. The new structure is much better extensible. Sources, parsers and formatters are completely independent now, so you can replace them with your own version..
- Feature: Downloading source data is now done with GuzzleHttp, which offers many additional options.
- Feature: SQLite is the new (faster) data storage of the default parser (one database file instead of many files).
- Feature: The default Formatter has been adjusted to exactly return the result of the PHP get_browser() function (boolean values differed and where 'true' and 'false' instead of '1' and '')
- Feature: Unit tests added.
- Feature: Property filters to filter the data generated by the parser and/or the data the formatter returns. If set for the parser, this reduces the data size and helps to improve the parser performance.
- Feature: Additional formatters, for example `Optimized`, with typed return values
- Feature: Command-line support added to update/filter the parser data (using Symfony Console)
- Feature: Library requires PHP >= 5.6 now.
